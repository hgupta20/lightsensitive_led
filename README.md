As the amount of light seen by the photoresistor decreases, increase the number of LEDs that are lit. 
You will be using 4 LEDS and a photoresistor. Put all 4 LEDs next to each (preferably the same
color). As the amount of light seen by the photoresistor decreases, increase the number of LEDs
that are lit. 

For example, if your circuit receives no light then all of the LEDs should light up. As
you continue to increase the amount of light, the number of LEDs that light up will decrease. So
when the photoresistor receives the half the amount of light, 2 LEDS should be lit up, and when
there is no light, all 4 LEDs should be lit up.
